# The-mysterious-lock-box
You come across a mysterious lock box that requires a 4-digit code to unlock. You find a note attached to the box with the following clues:

The first digit is three times the third digit.
The second digit is half the fourth digit.
The sum of all four digits is 14.
What is the correct 4-digit code to unlock the box?

Solution:
Let's represent the four digits as A, B, C, and D. Based on the clues, we can form the following equations:

A = 3C
B = D/2
A + B + C + D = 14
Substituting the first two equations into the third equation:

3C + D/2 + C + D = 14
Combine like terms:
4C + 3D = 14

Since the digits are integers, we need to find values of C and D that satisfy this equation and the conditions:

C can be 1 or 2 (since C can't be greater than 3, as it's thrice the third digit).
D can be 2 or 4 (since D can't be greater than 4, as it's half the fourth digit).
Let's try both possibilities:

Case 1: C = 1, D = 4
Then, A = 3 and B = 2
The code is 3241.

Case 2: C = 2, D = 2
Then, A = 6 and B = 1
The code is 6212.

So, there are two possible codes to unlock the box: 3241 and 6212.
